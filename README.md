## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

The recommended development environment for this project is Visual Studio 2013 or Visual Studio 2015. When using Visual
Studio 2015, a [custom analyzer](https://github.com/openstacknetsdk/OpenStackNetAnalyzers) is provided
which uses static analysis to identify common mistakes, and in many cases is able to automatically fix the issue.

### Build script

Execute `build.cmd` (or `build.sh` if you are using Git Bash).

See the [Documentation README](src/Documentation/README.md) if you would like to build the Sandcastle documentation which is published to http://openstacknetsdk.org/docs.

#### This is not an official OpenStack project
