# OpenStack.Net port to .Net Standard

This is a completely unsupported port of openstack.net to .net standard.

I have only done this because the Rackspace support for .net is so out of date and I have an urgent need to port an existing app from another language to .Net that uses Rackspace for storage.

Please note I have only tested the CloudFiles APIs as they are all I need, so all bets are off on any parts of the library I do not use.

I hope this is useful to someone.
